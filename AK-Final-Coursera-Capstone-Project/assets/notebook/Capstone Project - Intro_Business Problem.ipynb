This project is meant to provide this capability to those people as they try to assess new neighborhoods by understanding the ease of access to cafes, schools, supermarkets, pharmacies, malls, theatres, hospitals, etc.\n\nSpecifically, this project will focus on developing a thorough analysis of features for a people migrating to Scarborough through a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price, school ratings, crime rates, road connectivity, weather conditions, emergency management facilities, water resources. This will help people gain awareness of the area before investing in moving to a new city/state/country to start a new life."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Problem to be Solved"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The primary focus of this project is to research neighborhoods in a new city for people considering moving.
